                    <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">First let me thank everyone in Virtuoso for observing the various health directives in recent weeks and for all of the neighbourly support which has been displayed throughout Virtuoso.  I would also, on behalf of the Body Corporate Committee, express particular thanks and appreciation to Rhys Morgan for all the work he is doing to keep us safe and operational.  Thanks also needs to go to Stockwell Living and to Owen Welsh and his RGD colleagues who are continuing to work here under increasingly difficult circumstance.
<br><br>The Body Corporate Committee is keeping in touch via email, video conferencing and telephone.  We have had to make difficult decisions in recent days relating to the Gymnasium and the Pool.  Both of which have had to be closed.  The area outside the gym has been cleared of furniture to provide space for outside exercising.  However, please observe the Government directives that no more than two persons or one family group use the area at any one time.
<br><br>Some of our initiatives will need to be put on the back burner for the moment but there are few issues on which we will continue to focus.  One of these is the potentially date critical issue of Common Area Defects.  The Committee has now provided Stockwell and RGD with a consolidated list of defects which have been identified by the Engineers on the Committee and notified to us by residents.  Some of these will have already been identified by Mode Architects.  We have received a status report which identifies the many issues which have been rectified.  However, much needs to be done.  The work on the front lawn, for example, is designed to improve the waterproofing of the slab which forms the roof of the basement.  The trenches are to enable the waterproof membrane on the slab and the paved area to be joined up.  The soil and turf currently piled around the protected trees will be moved back into the trenches in the next day or so.  Cracks in the walkways are being epoxied and the walkways will then be re-surfaced with the same material which has been used on the slope leading to the Visitors’ car park. 
<br><br>The colour will change to a light grey as you can see from the photo. We are restricted to the colours offered by Protek. I am advised that the brown flecks that can be seen in the sample will be removed. A Technical Data Sheet is available to anyone who is interested.
<br><br>Contact has also been made in recent days with the Matthew Lawson, the recently appointed new CEO of RGD Building Group.  He has assured me that RGD is committed to Virtuoso for the long term and has every intention of fulfilling its obligations.  He has offered to meet with me regularly.  The RGD Board has paused all new work to enable resources to be focused on Virtuoso.  These verbal assurances are welcome but need to be confirmed by the Board in writing.  In the meantime the Committee is continuing to explore our legal and regulatory options.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Your Committee is working very well and has been in constant communication.  Along with one or more members I have fortnightly meetings with Stockwell representatives.  We have covered a wide range of topics including security, common area defects, key access to firestairs, care of the front lawns, documentation, a/c unit location.  We have also commissioned external reports in relation to insurance valuation, workplace health and safety, and the sinking fund. Residents’ health and safety is of paramount importance and we have summarised below some of the action we have taken to deal with COVID19 fallout. We have compiled a consolidated list of common area defects and are seeking an up to date report from RGD of remediation completed.  We have also agreed to engage lawyers to prepare for more formal action to ensure that Stockwell and RGD fulfill their obligations to remediate all common area defects within the warranty period.   We will be reviewing service contracts prior to renewal to ensure that we are receiving value for money.  We will also be exploring whether there is a more cost-effective solution to our current embedded electricity supplier. We have an ambitious agenda.  However, thankfully the Committee has a wide range of skills and experience which are willingly and unselfishly being used for the benefit of all residents. I would like to thank them and all of our community for the support and trust that has been extended to the Committee.</p>

                       In the past period we have been transitioning from a developr managed body corporate committee to one that is managed by the body coporate itself. Since its election at the AGM, the committee has been focusing on a range of issues including security, fire safety, common area defects, streamlining communication with the body corporate, workplace health and safety, insurance, and budget forecasting. There is much work to do, but it has been a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable and committed fellow committee members and with such an engaged and supportive body corporate (as evidenced in a number of ways, e.g. in the high turn-up at the recent first committee meeting or the willingness displayed to help the committee).</p>
